Database Migrations
===================

This directory contains Alembic database migrations for the ER Watch Scraper.

Commands
--------

# Check current migration status
alembic current

# Apply all pending migrations
alembic upgrade head

# Rollback one migration
alembic downgrade -1

# Rollback all migrations
alembic downgrade base

# Generate a new migration (auto-detect changes from models)
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "description of changes"

# Generate an empty migration (manual)
alembic revision -m "description of changes"

# View migration history
alembic history

# View SQL without executing (offline mode)
alembic upgrade head --sql

Notes
-----

- The initial migration (001) marks the baseline for existing tables.
- Run `alembic stamp head` on existing databases to mark them as up-to-date
  without running migrations (since tables already exist).
- Always review auto-generated migrations before applying them.
